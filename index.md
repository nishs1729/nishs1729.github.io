    Hello! <br><br>
    I’m a <b>postdoctoral fellow</b> in the <b>Computational Neurobiology Lab</b> at the <b>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research</b>, Pune. My research lies in the field of <b>computational neuroscience</b>, where I explore how the brain works using math, models, and simulations. In particular, I focus on uncovering the interplay between the structure and function of <b>hippocampal neurons</b>, bringing us a step closer to understanding the brain’s remarkable complexity. <br><br>

    When I’m not crunching numbers or running simulations, I love sharing the excitement of science with others. I’ve worked as a <b>teaching assistant</b> for several workshops and courses, and I regularly join <b>outreach programs</b> to inspire curiosity and critical thinking among school students.
    
    
    
    <!-- I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the Computational Neurobiology Lab at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER). My research sits at the fascinating intersection of mathematics, biology, and neuroscience — I use computational models and simulations to explore one of the most captivating puzzles of all time: how the brain works. In particular, I focus on uncovering how the structure of hippocampal neurons shapes their function, bringing us a step closer to understanding the brain’s remarkable complexity

    I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Computational Neurobiology Lab at IISER, where I get to explore how the brain works using math, models, and computer simulations — a blend of science and creativity that never stops fascinating me. My current research dives into how the structure of hippocampal neurons shapes what they do, helping us understand the intricate ways our brains make sense of the world.

    I am a post-doctoral fellow in the Computational Neurobiology Lab at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER). My research interests lie in the field of computational neuroscience, where I use mathematical modeling and simulations to understand, broadly speaking, how the brain works. My work focusses on understanding the structure-function relation in hippocampal neurons. <br><br>
    
    In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching and have been a teaching assistant for several workshops and undergraduate courses. Whenever feasible, I also take part in science outreach programs to promote scientific thinking among school children. -->

<!-- ## Research
---
My research focuses on understanding the role of synaptic design and plasticity in neural
signal processing, particularly within the hippocampus. I have studied how detailed structural and
biochemical properties orchestrate short-term plasticity in different hippocampal neurons. I
am currently studying detailed network models to investigate how short-term plasticity at synapses
influences phase precession, pattern separation, and place cell remapping.  -->
