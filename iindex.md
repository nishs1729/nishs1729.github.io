    Hello!<br><br>
    I am a post-doctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER),
    Pune, where I am a member of the Computational Neurobiology Lab. My research interests lie in
    the field of computational neuroscience, where I use mathematical modeling and simulations to
    understand how the brain works. I hold a PhD in Computational Neuroscience from IISER Pune and
    a BS-MS in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. <br><br>
    
    In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching and have been a teaching assistant
    for several undergraduate courses and workshops. I am also actively involved in science 
    outreach programs to promote scientific thinking among school children.

## Research
---
My research focuses on understanding the role of synaptic design and plasticity in neural
signal processing, particularly within the hippocampus. I have studied how detailed structural and
biochemical properties orchestrate short-term plasticity in different hippocampal neurons. I
am currently studying detailed network models to investigate how short-term plasticity at synapses
influences phase precession, pattern separation, and place cell remapping.
